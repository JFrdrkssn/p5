llAMA
</b></h1>

llAMA is a niche AMA-type platform for people to connect, ask and answer anything in a playful manner.

The purpose of the site is to provide a place where people can read, post, comment, follow, like and create a profile to interact with other users and provide a place where any questions or discussions can be had while also having fun.

Target audience is mainly younger people and others who are well-versed in internet culture, who will most likely also appreciate the entertainment value of the applications brand.

It is designed to look and feel similar applications like Twitter and Instagram. It has a simple layout to encourage a lighter spin on anything being posted or discussed on the app.

Users can register an account to access full CRUD functionality for different interactions across the site.

As an early build, llAMA is currently a barebones/MVP application.

The frontend application is connected to the llAMA API, a custom-built backend application designed specifically for the llAMA app. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JFrdrkssn/llama-be).

# **Design**

<br/>

![Logo](src/assets/screenshots/logo-llama.png)
<br/><br/>

- ## **Brand**

  - The brand logo is a llama, which is also the name of the application. It has long been a popular animal in internet culture, most often used in memes, GIFs and other content meant primarily for entertainment purposes.
  - The brand and logo fits nicely with the project goal of creating a social media app that doesn't take it itself too seriously.

  <br/><br/>

- ## **Color Scheme**

  - A dark grey background coupled with a light shade of grey for text provides the basis for application with clear contrast that is easy on the eyes. Shades of blue and orange declare interactive elements, such as links and buttons, contrasted with white elements for interactions such as unliking and unfollowing.
  - The navigation bar and content cards on the application has a sligthly brighter dark grey background, providing some contrast between the main background and other content.
  - CTA elements are light blue.
  - Like icons on user's owned posts are red to visually differentiate and declare it as non-interactive.

- ## **Typography**

  - The Indie Flower font is used for the site logo. The font has a playful look and fits well with brand logo, a llama.
  - The Roboto font is used everywhere else on the site. It is clear, sleek and provide a good separation between characters, making it easy to read and blending in well. It is also one of the most popular fonts used in web applications today.
  - Sans-serif is used as a backup-font.

## **Wireframes**

<br/>
Wireframes for the application are essentially the same as the finished site.
