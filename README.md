llAMA
</b></h1>

llAMA is a niche AMA-type platform for people to connect, ask and answer anything in a playful manner.

The purpose of the site is to provide a place where people can read, post, comment, follow, like and create a profile to interact with other users and provide a place where any questions or discussions can be had while also having fun.

Target audience is mainly younger people and others who are well-versed in internet culture, who will most likely also appreciate the entertainment value of the applications brand.

It is designed to look and feel similar applications like Twitter and Instagram. It has a simple layout to encourage a lighter spin on anything being posted or discussed on the app.

Users can register an account to access full CRUD functionality for different interactions across the site.

As an early build, llAMA is currently a barebones/MVP application.

The frontend application is connected to the llAMA API, a custom-built backend application designed specifically for the llAMA app. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JFrdrkssn/llama-be).
